  WorldContext: Tiresias has made their peace with the fact their world was destroyed,
    and decided to call this new world their home. The monster, Polia has not and
    out of grief, directionlessness or a mix of both, decided to reform this new
    realm into a shadow of its old one. Not wanting to lose a second home, Tiresias
    chooses to stand against Polia, even if it means killing another of their kind.
