  OptionTitle: "The monster I\u2019m hunting, what is it?"
  WorldContext: "In its old realm, the monster was known as Polia. When Polia was
    born, it was given the power of \u201Ccreation\u201D. It was able to conjure
    and construct anything, limited only in imagination, inspired by the architects
    of old and new. Polia was meant to be a tool for progress and it was. But when
    its old realm was destroyed, Polia became corrupted as it traveled to this new
    realm. Now, it has made its sole purpose to destroy this new realm so it can
    reshape it to its vision of \u201Ca new home\u201D."
